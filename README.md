# Tic-Tac-Toe Reinforcement Learning Implementation [Mar 2018 - May 2018]

Developed an advanced Tic-Tac-Toe implementation using Reinforcement Learning algorithms in the C programming language. This project involved two types of implementations, aimed at enhancing the gameplay experience and improving the AI's decision-making capabilities.

RL Learning - Learning from Player's Moves:
In this implementation, the AI agent learns from the player's moves during the game. By observing the player's strategies and analyzing the outcomes, the AI agent gradually improves its decision-making process. This adaptive learning approach allows the AI to dynamically adjust its gameplay style to counter the player's moves effectively. 

RL Self Learning - Advanced Self-Play and Winning Gameplay Moves:
The second implementation involves an advanced self-learning mechanism. The AI agent engages in self-play, exploring all possible moves and scenarios. During this self-play phase, the AI agent analyzes the outcomes of different moves and stores the winning gameplay moves. By leveraging this stored knowledge, the AI agent is able to make more informed decisions during actual gameplay against human opponents.
